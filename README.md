# Reason For Using this module.
    Really there is is not reason, I only made this to have something to do and 
    build my knowledge in python.  I will though make a few games with it after I get this 
    module working.  Lots and lots of work ahead still.


# Screen Shot
This is what I have so far, not much but it's a work in progress.


Placement of objects on screen and move it with key bindings.

know....yet
